  <p>I am a PhD Candidate at MIT Sloan School of Management, the Behavioral and Policy Sciences (BPS) area.</p>
    
  <p>My research focuses on organizational processes surrounding diversity and decision-making. In my job market paper, I study how remote work options affect career choicesâ€”exploring the implications of shifting towards work-from-anywhere on job seekers' decisions, and its consequences for gender equality.</p>
