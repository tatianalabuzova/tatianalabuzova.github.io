  <p>I am a PhD Candidate at MIT Sloan in the Behavioral and Policy Sciences (BPS) area.</p>
    
  <p>My research focuses on labor market dynamics and the factors contributing to disparities. In my job market paper, I study how remote work options affect job application choices, including the implications of shifting towards work-from-anywhere on job seekers' decisions, and its consequences for gender equality.</p>
