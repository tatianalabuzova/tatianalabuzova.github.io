### Dissertation Project

<span style="color:#000000"><b>Tatiana Labuzova</b></span> " Work-from-Anywhere and Gender Equality: The Gendered Effects of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Job Posting Views and Application Submissions." _In progress_. 

<p>In a pre-registered study of over 1,000,000 job seekers, I analyze the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on job search behavior. Specifically, I explore the natural experiment of the lockdowns to examine how the external shock to the availability of work-from-anywhere jobs influences supply-side job search behavior and the gender wage gap in pursued positions.</p>
