### Dissertation Project

<b>Tatiana Labuzova</b> " Work-from-Anywhere and Gender Equality: The Gendered Effects of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Job Posting Views and Application Submissions." _In progress_. 

<p style="margin-left:10%">In a pre-registered study of more than 1,000,000 job seekers, I analyze the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the job search behavior. In particular, exploring the natural experiment of the lockdowns, I examine how the external shock to the provision of work-from-anywhere jobs affects supply-side job search behavior and the gender gap in the level of offered compensation for those jobs.</p>
